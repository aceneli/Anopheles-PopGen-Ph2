### PCA Plots
https://github.com/aceneli/Anopheles-mosquitoes-March-24/tree/main/Plink%20codes<br/>
The PCA plots were generated by the following steps:
1. Prune the data using the linkage pruning code:https://github.com/aceneli/Anopheles-mosquitoes-March-24/tree/main/Plink%20codes/Linkage%20Pruning%20of%20VCF%20Data<br/>
2. Generate the PCA data using the output files from the linkage pruning analyses:https://github.com/aceneli/Anopheles-mosquitoes-March-24/tree/main/Plink%20codes/PCA%20eigenvec%20and%20eigenval%20files%20generation<br/>
3. Plot PCA data using R or Python codes. (Python plot code: https://github.com/aceneli/Anopheles-mosquitoes-March-24/blob/main/Codes%20for%20Different%20Data%20Visualisation%20Plots/Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20(PCA)0<br/> and R plot code: https://github.com/aceneli/Anopheles-mosquitoes-March-24/tree/main/R%20Codes
